             I find joy in creating beautiful things. 
             Whether I’m at my easel or coding the next website, 
             creativity fuels my drive. 
             I utilize my diverse background as an artist, f
             ull-stack developer and educator to invent innovative 
             solutions to complex problems. 
             I consider myself a supportive leader and invested collaborator, 
             finding potential in my colleagues to be strengthened and showcased. 
             When I’m not at my easel or computer, 
             you can find me spending time with my wife and daughter 
             who inspire me to be the best version of me I can be.</p>
